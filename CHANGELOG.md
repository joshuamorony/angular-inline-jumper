# Change Log

## 1.1.1

- Adds support for default exports

## 1.1.0

- Jumping will now scroll as much of the relevant section (i.e. template/style/class) into view as possible. For example, previously if you cursor was above `styles` and `styles` as off screen, jumping to `styles` would just jump the cursor to the `styles` property, but you would still have to scroll down to see the styles. This change fixes that.

## 1.0.1

- Updated README

## 1.0.0

- Changed default keybinding
- Added logo

## 0.0.1

- Initial release
